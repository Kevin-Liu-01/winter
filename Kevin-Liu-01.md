# Project Name
ResinRehab - Revolutionizing Recovery

## Summary

For this project, I am going to build "ResinRehab," a 3D printed finger splint that will prevent the range of motion of a finger while it is healing from either a chronic condition or injury/break. 

ResinRehab aims to provide users with a reliable, comfortable, and easy-to-use splint that helps them recover from finger injuries. The splints will be  designed using Fusion 360 and will be printed using high-quality resin material. They can be customized to fit the specific needs of individual users, and thus provide an affordable and reproducible alternative to store-purchased splints that can be either rare or pricey. The goal of ResinRehab is to help people recover from finger injuries more quickly and effectively, and to provide them with a high-quality splint that meets their needs.

I am excited to build this project because I believe that by developing a functional, comfortable splint, I can help people recover more quickly and effectively, and improve their quality of life. I am also excited to explore the technical challenges of building a device like this, and to learn 
more about the possibilities of using resin for medical applications. Additionally, if this works, it would be a proof of concept for an ultra-cheap 
splint made of resin that would not only be more comfortable but more accessible as well.

I am specifically using resin instead of traditional 3d printer filament. There are several reasons why using resin instead of plastic is better for medical devices such as a splint:

1. Resin is generally stronger and more durable than plastic: Resin is known for its high strength-to-weight ratio, which means it can be used to create lightweight yet sturdy structures. This can be particularly useful in a project like a splint, where the parts need to be strong enough to withstand the forces of everyday use, but also lightweight enough to be comfortable for the user to wear.

2. Resin can be more flexible and resistant to breaking: Some types of resin, such as urethane resin, are known for their flexibility and ability to withstand impact. This can make them more resistant to breaking or cracking under stress, which can be an advantage in a project like a splint, where the parts may be subjected to a wide range of forces and movements as a result of being on the hand.

3. Resin can be used to create intricate and detailed parts: Many types of resin are known for their ability to create intricate and detailed parts, thanks to their smooth, glossy finish and ability to hold fine details. This can be useful in a project like a splint, where the parts are very small but need to be very exact to perfectly fit the contour of an individual's unique finger.

4. Resin is more comfortable - plastic often leaves sharp, gnarled edges while resin forms smooth, even shapes that are better for complex contours like those of the hand. This is better for the end user's comfort.

## Plan

1. Design: Design the hand in Fusion 360 to create a detailed 3D model of the splint, including all the parts and components. I will use
scientific literature to ensure my design is sound. As such, I will consider the size and shape of the finger, as well as the types of movements and tasks it will need to be able to perform.

2. 3D print the parts: Use a 3D printer to print all the parts for the splint. To fit on the finger, it will essentially be a shell splint into two parts - one on top of the finger and one below, on the fingerpads. Appropriate settings and procedures will be used to achieve the desired results.

3. Assemble the splint: Once the parts are printed, they will be attached together. Additionally, parts like string can be used to allow the user to freely adjust the splint's tightness as desired. This will allow customizability in the sense that it can be adjusted to fit different sized or shaped fingers. I will use a 3d print finishing kit to adjust certain parts and create certain shapes as necessary.

4. Testing: Once the splint  is assembled, I will test it to make sure all the parts are working correctly and that the hand is able to perform the desired tasks. 
This may involve picking up items and ensuring it does not get in the way or impair normal movements. I will use the 3d print finishing kit with sandpaper to sand and smooth off parts as necessary.

5. Fine-tune and refine: As I test and use the splint, I will most likely need to make adjustments and refinements to the design and code to make it more 
effective and reliable. I will be able to use my own hand for testing. I am prepared to iterate and improve the splint as I go.

Originally, I considered outsourcing the resin printing to a 3rd party company, but as I began brainstorming I realized that this would be too inefficient for my project.
I would have little to no control over the printing process and would not be able to make changes and adjustments as needed. This is particularly unfortunate for 
prototyping and testing multiple designs or making quick changes on the fly. I can only begin designing and testing a new iteration when the company is ready,
forcing me to wait for the new design to arrive any time I make any design change, which is contrary to rapid prototyping and would most likely go over the 10 days
I would have for this project. On top of that, I would have to pay for the shipping, (potentially) the resin, and a whole bunch of other costs, like service fees, 
and I would not be able to present these costs upfront (a stipulation for a grant).

As such, because it was in my  combined budget, I decided to buy a 3D printer and resin instead. It may take some time out of the 10 days to assemble, 
but it will save me a lot of time in the prototyping and testing cycle. It will ultimately save me an extremely valuable amount of time in the development process 
and allow me to quickly prototype and test different hand designs.
